Text Adventure First Person Shooter!

The idea came from what would happen if we took the atmosphere of a text adventure like Zork and threw on FPS controls. How would it handle? Well, evidently, it handles like some bastard roguelike.

The game is also completely built on client-server, but it's simple enough to just make local games. We use the kryonet library for that networking deal. The rest is hacked together.
